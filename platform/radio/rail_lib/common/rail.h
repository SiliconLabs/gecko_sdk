/// @addtogroup Sleep
/// @brief These APIs help when putting the system to an EM2/EM3/EM4 sleep
/// states where the high frequency clock is disabled.
/// @{
///
/// The RAIL library has its own timebase and the ability to schedule operations
/// into the future. When going to any power mode that disables the HF clock
/// used for the radio (EM2/EM3/EM4), it is important that this timebase is
/// synchronized to a running LFCLK and the chip is set to wake up before the
/// next scheduled event.
/// If RAIL has not been configured to use the power manager,
/// \ref RAIL_Sleep and \ref RAIL_Wake must be called for performing this
/// synchronization.
/// If RAIL has been configured to use the power manager,
/// \ref RAIL_InitPowerManager, it will automatically perform timer
/// synchronization based on the selected \ref RAIL_TimerSyncConfig_t. Calls to
/// \ref RAIL_Sleep and \ref RAIL_Wake are unsupported in such a scenario.
///
/// Following example code snippets demonstrate synchronizing the timebase
/// with and without timer synchronization:
///
/// <b>Sleep with timer synchronization:</b>
///
/// When sleeping with timer synchronization, you must first get the required
/// LFCLK up and running and leave it running across sleep so that the high
/// frequency clock that drives the RAIL time base can be synchronized to it.
/// The \ref RAIL_Sleep() API will also set up a wake event on the timer to wake
/// up wakeupTime before the next timer event so that it can run successfully.
/// See the \ref efr32_main sections on Low-Frequency Clocks and RAIL Timer
/// Synchronization for more setup details.
///
/// This is useful when maintaining packet timestamps
/// across sleep or use the scheduled RX/TX APIs while sleeping in between. It
/// does take more time and code to do the synchronization. If your
/// application does not need this, it should be avoided.
///
/// Example (without Power Manager):
/// @code{.c}
/// #include <rail.h>
/// #include <rail_types.h>

/// RAIL APIs such as, \ref RAIL_StartScheduledTx, \ref RAIL_ScheduleRx,

/// Upon completion, each instantaneous or scheduled RX/TX operation will
/// indicate radio busy to the power manager to allow the application to
/// service the RAIL event and perform subsequent operations before going to
/// sleep. Therefore, it is important that the application idle the radio by either
/// calling \ref RAIL_Idle or \ref RAIL_YieldRadio.
/// If the radio transitions to RX after an RX or TX operation,
/// always call \ref RAIL_Idle in order transition to a lower sleep state.
/// If the radio transitions to idle after an RX or TX operation,
/// \ref RAIL_YieldRadio should suffice in indicating to the power manager
/// that the radio is no longer busy and the device can sleep.

/// The following example shows scheduling periodic TX on getting a TX completion

///     };
///     (void)RAIL_StartScheduledTx(radio.handle, channel, 0, &config, NULL);

/// @endcode
///
/// @note The above code assumes that RAIL automatic state transitions after TX
///       are idle. Set \ref RAIL_SetTxTransitions to ensure the right state
///       transitions. Radio must be idle for the device to enter EM2 or lower
///       energy mode.
///
/// @note When using the power manager, usage of \ref RAIL_YieldRadio in
///       single protocol RAIL is similar to its usage in multiprotocol RAIL.
///       See \ref rail_radio_scheduler_yield for more details.

/// <b>Sleep without timer synchronization:</b>

/// @addtogroup Data_Management Data Management
/// @brief Data management functions
///
/// These functions allow the application to choose how data is presented to
/// the application. RAIL provides data in a packet-based method or in a
/// FIFO-based method. As originally conceived,
/// \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE was designed for handling packets
/// that fit within RAIL's FIFOs while \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE
/// was designed for handling packets larger than RAIL's FIFOs could hold.
/// Conceptually it is still useful to think of these modes this way, but
/// functionally their distinction has become blurred by improvements in
/// RAIL's flexibility -- applications now have much more control over both
/// receive and transmit FIFO sizes, and the FIFO-management and threshold
/// APIs and related events are no longer restricted to \ref
/// RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE operation but can be used in \ref
/// RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE too.
///
/// The application can configure RAIL data management through
/// RAIL_ConfigData(). This function allows the application to specify the type
/// of radio data (\ref RAIL_TxDataSource_t and \ref RAIL_RxDataSource_t) and
/// the method of interacting with data (\ref RAIL_DataMethod_t). By default,
/// RAIL configures TX and RX both with packet data source and \ref
/// RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE.
///
/// For transmit, \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE and \ref
/// RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE are functionally the same:
///   - When not actively transmitting, load a packet's initial transmit
///     data using RAIL_WriteTxFifo() with reset set to true. Alternatively
///     this data copying can be avoided by changing the transmit FIFO to an
///     already-loaded section of memory with \ref RAIL_SetTxFifo().
///   - When actively transmitting, load remaining transmit data with
///     RAIL_WriteTxFifo() with reset set to false.
///   - If transmit packets exceed the FIFO size, set the transmit FIFO
///     threshold through RAIL_SetTxFifoThreshold(). The \ref
///     RAIL_Config_t::eventsCallback with \ref RAIL_EVENT_TX_FIFO_ALMOST_EMPTY
///     will occur telling the application to load more TX packet data, if
///     needed, to prevent a \ref RAIL_EVENT_TX_UNDERFLOW event from occurring.
///     One can get how much space is available in the transmit FIFO for more
///     transmit data through RAIL_GetTxFifoSpaceAvailable().
///   - After transmit completes, the transmit FIFO can be manually reset
///     with RAIL_ResetFifo(), but this should rarely be necessary.
///
/// The transmit FIFO is specified by the application and its size is
/// the value returned from the most recent call to RAIL_SetTxFifo().
/// The transmit FIFO is edge-based in that it only provides the \ref
/// RAIL_EVENT_TX_FIFO_ALMOST_EMPTY event once when the threshold is crossed
/// in the emptying direction.
///
/// For receive, the distinction between \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE
/// and \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE basically boils down to how
/// unsuccessfully-received packets are handled. In \ref
/// RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE, data from such packets is automatically
/// rolled back as if the packet was never received, while in \ref
/// RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE, rollback does not occur putting more onus
/// on the application to deal with that data.
///
/// In receive \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE data management:
///   - Packet lengths are determined from the Radio Configurator configuration
///     and can be read out at the end using \ref RAIL_GetRxPacketInfo().
///   - Received packet data is made available on successful packet completion
///     via \ref RAIL_Config_t::eventsCallback with \ref
///     RAIL_EVENT_RX_PACKET_RECEIVED which can then use RAIL_GetRxPacketInfo()
///     and RAIL_GetRxPacketDetailsAlt() to access packet information and
///     RAIL_PeekRxPacket() to access packet data.
///   - Filtered, Aborted, or FrameError received packet data is automatically
///     rolled back (dropped) without the application needing to worry about
///     consuming it.
///     The application can choose to not even be bothered with the events
///     related to such packets: \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_ADDRESS_FILTERED,
///     \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_PACKET_ABORTED, or \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FRAME_ERROR.
///
/// In receive \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE data management:
///   - Packet Lengths are determined from the Radio Configurator configuration
///     or by application knowledge of packet payload structure.
///   - Received data can be retrieved prior to packet completion through
///     RAIL_ReadRxFifo() and is never rolled back on Filtered, Aborted, or
///     FrameError packets. The application should enable and handle these
///     events so it can flush any packet data it's already retrieved.
///   - After packet completion, remaining packet data for Filtered, Aborted,
///     or FrameError packets remains in the FIFO and the appropriate event is
///     triggered to the user. This data may be consumed in the callback unlike
///     in packet mode where it is automatically rolled back. At the end of the
///     callback all remaining data in the FIFO will be cleaned up as usual.
///     Keep in mind that RAIL_GetRxPacketDetailsAlt() provides packet detailed
///     information only for successfully received packets.
///
/// Common receive data management features:
///   - Set the receive FIFO threshold through RAIL_SetRxFifoThreshold(). The
///     \ref RAIL_Config_t::eventsCallback with \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL
///     will occur telling the application to consume some RX packet data to
///     prevent a \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW event from occurring.
///   - Get receive FIFO count information through
///     RAIL_GetRxPacketInfo(\ref RAIL_RX_PACKET_HANDLE_NEWEST)
///     (or RAIL_GetRxFifoBytesAvailable()).
///   - After receive completes and all its data has been consumed, the receive
///     FIFO can be manually reset with RAIL_ResetFifo(), though this should
///     rarely be necessary and should only be done with the radio idle.
///
/// When trying to determine an appropriate threshold, the application needs
/// to know the size of each FIFO. The default receive FIFO is internal to RAIL
/// with a size of 512 bytes. This can be changed, however, using
/// \ref RAIL_SetRxFifo() and the default may be removed entirely by calling
/// this from the RAILCb_SetupRxFifo() callback. The receive FIFO event is
/// level-based in that the \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL event will
/// constantly pend if the threshold is exceeded. This normally means that
/// inside this event's callback, the application should empty enough of the FIFO
/// to go under the threshold. To defer reading the FIFO to main context, the
/// application can disable or re-enable the receive FIFO threshold event using
/// RAIL_ConfigEvents() with the mask \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL.
///
/// The receive FIFO can store multiple packets and processing of a packet can
/// be deferred from the RAIL event callback to main-loop processing
/// by using RAIL_HoldRxPacket() in the event callback and
/// RAIL_ReleaseRxPacket() in the main-loop.
/// On some platforms, the receive FIFO is supplemented by an internal
/// fixed-size packet metadata FIFO that limits the number of packets
/// RAIL and applications can hold onto for deferred processing.
/// See chip-specific documentation, such as \ref efr32_main, for more
/// information. Note that when using multiprotocol the receive FIFO is reset
/// prior to a protocol switch so held packets will be lost if not processed
/// before then.
///
/// While \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL occurs solely based on the
/// state of the receive FIFO used for packet data, both
/// \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_FULL and \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW
/// can occur coincident with packet completion when either that or the
/// internal packet metadata FIFO fills or overflows.
/// \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_FULL informs the application it should
/// immediately process and free up the oldest packets/data to make room
/// for new packets/data, reducing the possibility of packet/data loss
/// and \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW.
///
/// Before a packet is fully received you can always use
/// RAIL_PeekRxPacket() to look at the contents. In FIFO mode, you may also
/// consume its data with \ref RAIL_ReadRxFifo(). Remember that none of these
/// APIs will read across a packet boundary (even in FIFO mode) so you will
/// need to handle each received packet individually.
///
/// While RAIL defaults to \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE, the
/// application can explicitly initialize RAIL for \ref
/// RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE in the following manner:
/// @code{.c}
/// extern RAIL_Handle_t railHandle;

 * RAIL data management configuration
 *
 * @param[in] railHandle A RAIL instance handle.
 * @param[in] dataConfig RAIL data configuration structure.
 * @return Status code indicating success of the function call.
 *
 * This function configures how RAIL manages data. The application can
 * configure RAIL to receive data in a packet-based or FIFO-based manner.
 * \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE is necessary to receive packets larger
 * than the radio's receive FIFO. It is also required for receive data
 * sources other than \ref RAIL_RxDataSource_t::RX_PACKET_DATA.
 *
 * Generally with \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE, the application sets
 * appropriate FIFO thresholds via RAIL_SetTxFifoThreshold() and
 * RAIL_SetRxFifoThreshold() and then enables and handles the
 * \ref RAIL_EVENT_TX_FIFO_ALMOST_EMPTY event callback (to feed more packet
 * data via RAIL_WriteTxFifo() before the FIFO underflows) and the \ref
 * RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL event callback (to consume packet data
 * via RAIL_ReadRxFifo() before the receive FIFO overflows).
 *
 * When configuring TX for \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE, this
 * function resets the transmit FIFO. When configuring TX or RX for
 * \ref RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE, this function will reset
 * the corresponding FIFO thresholds such that they won't trigger the
 * \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_ALMOST_FULL or \ref RAIL_EVENT_TX_FIFO_ALMOST_EMPTY
 * events.
 *
 * When \ref RAIL_DataConfig_t::rxMethod is set to \ref
 * RAIL_DataMethod_t::FIFO_MODE, the radio won't drop packet data of
 * aborted or CRC error packets, but will present it to the application
 * to deal with accordingly. On completion of erroneous packets, the
 * \ref RAIL_Config_t::eventsCallback with \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_PACKET_ABORTED,
 * \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FRAME_ERROR, or \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_ADDRESS_FILTERED will
 * tell the application it can drop any data it read via RAIL_ReadRxFifo() during reception.
 * For CRC error packets when the \ref RAIL_RX_OPTION_IGNORE_CRC_ERRORS
 * RX option is in effect, the application should check for that from the
 * \ref RAIL_RxPacketStatus_t obtained by calling RAIL_GetRxPacketInfo().
 * RAIL will automatically flush any remaining packet data after reporting
 * one of these packet completion events or the application can explicitly
 * flush it by calling RAIL_ReleaseRxPacket().
 *
 * When \ref RAIL_DataConfig_t::rxMethod is set to \ref
 * RAIL_DataMethod_t::PACKET_MODE, the radio will roll back (drop) all packet
 * data associated with aborted packets including those with CRC errors
 * (unless configured to ignore CRC errors via the
 * \ref RAIL_RX_OPTION_IGNORE_CRC_ERRORS RX option). The application will
 * never have to deal with packet data from these packets.
 * In either mode, the application can set RX options as needed.
 *
 * When \ref RAIL_DataConfig_t::rxSource is set to a value other than
 * \ref RX_PACKET_DATA and \ref RAIL_Config_t::eventsCallback
 * \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW is enabled RX will be terminated
 * if a RX FIFO overflow occurs.  If \ref RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_OVERFLOW
 * is not enabled, data will be discarded until the overflow condition
 * is resolved.  To continue capturing data RX must be restarted using
 * \ref RAIL_StartRx().

 * Data will be transmitted from the Transmit FIFO. If the Transmit FIFO does
 * not have sufficient data to transmit, a TX error will be caused and a \ref

/// @addtogroup PA Power Amplifier (PA)
/// @brief APIs for interacting with one of the on chip PAs.
///
/// These APIs let you configure the on-chip PA to get the appropriate output
/// power.
///
/// These are the function types:
///   1) Configuration functions: These functions set and get configuration
///      for the PA. In this case, "configuration" refers to a) indicating
///      which PA to use, b) the voltage supplied by your board to the PA,
///      and c) the ramp time over which to ramp the PA up to its full
///      power.
///   2) Power-setting functions: These functions consume the actual
///      values written to the PA registers and write them appropriately.
///      These values are referred to as "(raw) power levels". The range of
///      acceptable values for these functions depends on which PA is
///      currently active. The higher the power level set, the higher
///      the dBm power output by the chip. However, the mapping
///      between dBm and these power levels can vary greatly between
///      modules/boards.
///   3) Conversion functions: These functions convert
///      between the "power levels" discussed previously and the
///      dBm values output by the chip. Continue reading for more information
///      about unit conversion.
///
/// The accuracy of the chip output power is application-specific.
/// For some protocols or channels, the protocol itself or
/// legal limitations require applications to know exactly what power
/// they're transmitting at, in dBm. Other applications do not have
/// these restrictions, and users determine power level(s)
/// that fit their criteria for the trade-off between radio range and
/// power savings, regardless of what dBm power that maps to.
///
/// \ref RAIL_ConvertRawToDbm and \ref RAIL_ConvertDbmToRaw,
/// which convert between the dBm power and the raw power levels,
/// provide a solution that fits all these applications.
/// The levels of customizability are outlined below:
///  1) No customizability needed: for a given dBm value, the result
///     of RAIL_ConvertDbmToRaw provides an appropriate
///     raw power level that, when written to the registers via
///     RAIL_SetPowerLevel, causes the chip to output at that
///     dBm power. In this case, no action is needed by the user,
///     the WEAK versions of the conversion functions can be used
///     and the default include paths in pa_conversions_efr32.h can
///     be used.
///  2) The mapping of power level to dBm is not ideal, but the
///     level of precision is sufficient: In pa_conversions_efr32.c,
///     the WEAK versions of the conversion functions work by using
///     8-segment piecewise linear curves to convert between dBm
///     and power levels for PA's with hundreds of power levels
///     and simple mapping tables for use with PA's with only a few
///     levels. If this method is sufficiently precise, but the mapping
///     between power levels and dBm is incorrect,
///     copy pa_curves_efr32.h into a new file, updating the segments
///     to form a better fit (_DCDC_CURVES or _VBAT_CURVES defines) and
///     then add the RAIL_PA_CURVES define to your build with the path
///     to the new file.
///  3) A different level of precision is needed and the fit is bad:
///     If the piecewise-linear line segment fit is not appropriate for
///     your solution, the functions in pa_conversions_efr32.c can be
///     totally rewritten, as long as RAIL_ConvertDbmToRaw and
///     RAIL_ConvertRawToDbm have the same signatures. It is completely
///     acceptable to re-write these in a way that makes the
///     pa_curves_efr32.h and pa_curve_types_efr32.h files referenced in
///     pa_conversions_efr32.h unnecessary. Those files are needed solely
///     for the provided conversion methods.
///  4) dBm values are not necessary: If the application does not require
///     dBm values at all, overwrite
///     RAIL_ConvertDbmToRaw and RAIL_ConvertRawToDbm with smaller functions
///     (i.e., return 0 or whatever was input). These functions are called
///     from within the RAIL library, so they can never be deadstripped,
///     but making them as small as possible is the best way to reduce code
///     size. From there, call RAIL_SetTxPower, without
///     converting from a dBm value. To stop the library from coercing the
///     power based on channels, overwrite RAIL_ConvertRawToDbm
///     to always return 0 and overwrite RAIL_ConvertDbmToRaw to
///     always return 255.
///
/// The following is example code that shows how to initialize your PA
/// @code{.c}

 * Address Filtering (RX)
 *****************************************************************************/
/**
 * @addtogroup Address_Filtering Address Filtering
 * @brief Configuration APIs for receive packet address filtering.
 *
 * The address filtering code examines the packet as follows.
 *
 * | `Bytes: 0 - 255` | `0 - 8`  | `0 - 255` | `0 - 8`  | `Variable` |
 * |:----------------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|:----------:|
 * | `Data0`          | `Field0` | `Data1`   | `Field1` | `Data2`    |
 *
 * In the above structure, anything listed as DataN is an optional section of
 * bytes that RAIL will not process for address filtering. The FieldN segments
 * reference specific sections in the packet that will each be interpreted
 * as an address during address filtering. The application may submit up to
 * four addresses to attempt to match each field segment and each address may
 * have a size of up to 8 bytes. To set up address filtering, first configure
 * the locations and length of the addresses in the packet. Next, configure
 * which combinations of matches in Field0 and Field1 should constitute an
 * address match. Last, enter addresses into tables for each field and
 * enable them. The first two of these are part of the \ref RAIL_AddrConfig_t
 * structure while the second part is configured at runtime using the
 * RAIL_SetAddressFilterAddress() API. A brief description of each
 * configuration is listed below.
 *
 * The offsets and sizes of the fields
 * are assumed fixed for the RAIL address filter. To set them, specify
 * arrays for these values in the sizes and offsets entries in the
 * \ref RAIL_AddrConfig_t structure. A size of zero indicates that a field is
 * disabled. The start offset for a field is relative to the previous start
 * offset and, if you're using FrameType decoding, the first start offset is
 * relative to the end of the byte containing the frame type.
 *
 * Configuring which combinations of Field0 and Field1 constitute a match is
 * the most complex portion of the address filter. The easiest way to think
 * about this is with a truth table. If you consider each of the four possible
 * address entries in a field, you can have a match on any one of those or a
 * match for none of them. This is shown in the 5x5 truth table below where
 * Field0 matches are the rows and Field1 matches are the columns.
 *
 * |                | No Match | Address 0 | Address 1 | Address 2 | Address 3 |
 * |----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
 * | __No Match__   | bit0     | bit1      | bit2      | bit3      | bit4      |
 * | __Address 0__  | bit5     | bit6      | bit7      | bit8      | bit9      |
 * | __Address 1__  | bit10    | bit11     | bit12     | bit13     | bit14     |
 * | __Address 2__  | bit15    | bit16     | bit17     | bit18     | bit19     |
 * | __Address 3__  | bit20    | bit21     | bit22     | bit23     | bit24     |
 *
 * Because this is only 25 bits, it can be represented in one 32-bit integer
 * where 1 indicates a filter pass and 0 indicates a filter fail. This is the
 * matchTable parameter in the configuration structure and is used during
 * filtering. For common simple configurations, two defines are provided with
 * the truth tables as shown below. The first is \ref
 * ADDRCONFIG_MATCH_TABLE_SINGLE_FIELD, which can be used if only using
 * one address field (either field). If using two fields and want to
 * force in the same address entry in each field, use the second define: \ref
 * ADDRCONFIG_MATCH_TABLE_DOUBLE_FIELD. For more complex systems,
 * create a valid custom table.
 *
 * @note Address filtering does not function reliably with PHYs that use a data
 *   rate greater than 500 kbps. If this is a requirement, filtering must
 *   currently be done by the application.

/// The acknowledgment transmits based on the frame format configured via

/// length scheme, the ACK will be sent according to that scheme. If a 10-byte
/// packet is loaded into the ACK, but the variable length field of the ACK
/// payload specifies a length of 5, only 5 bytes will transmit for the ACK.
/// The converse is also true, if the frame length is configured to be a fixed
/// 10-byte packet but only 5 bytes are loaded into the ACK buffer, a TX
/// underflow occurs during the ACK transmit.
///
/// Unlike in non-auto-ACK mode, auto-ACK mode will always return to a single
/// state after all ACK sequences complete, regardless of whether
/// the ACK was successfully received/sent or not. See the documentation
/// of \ref RAIL_ConfigAutoAck() for configuration information. To
/// suspend automatic acknowledgment of a series of packets after transmit
/// or receive call RAIL_PauseTxAutoAck() or RAIL_PauseRxAutoAck() respectively
/// with the pause parameter set to true. When auto-ACKing is paused, after
/// receiving or transmitting a packet (regardless of success), the radio
/// transitions to the same state it would use while ACKing. To return to
/// normal state transition logic outside of ACKing, call \ref
/// RAIL_ConfigAutoAck() with the \ref RAIL_AutoAckConfig_t::enable field false
/// and specify the desired transitions in the \ref
/// RAIL_AutoAckConfig_t::rxTransitions and RAIL_AutoAckConfig_t::txTransitions
/// fields. To get out of a paused state and resume auto-ACKing, call
/// RAIL_PauseTxAutoAck() and/or RAIL_PauseRxAutoAck() with the pause parameter
/// set to false.
///
/// Applications can cancel the transmission of an ACK with
/// RAIL_CancelAutoAck(). Conversely, applications can control if a transmit
/// operation should wait for an ACK after transmitting by using
/// the \ref RAIL_TX_OPTION_WAIT_FOR_ACK option.
///
/// When \ref Antenna_Control is used for multiple antennas, ACKs are
/// transmitted on the antenna that was selected to receive the packet
/// being acknowledged. When receiving an ACK, the
/// \ref RAIL_RxOptions_t antenna options are used just like for any other
/// receive.
///
/// If the ACK payload is dynamic, the application must call
/// RAIL_WriteAutoAckFifo() with the appropriate ACK payload after the
/// application processes the receive. RAIL can auto-ACK from the normal
/// transmit buffer if RAIL_UseTxFifoForAutoAck() is called before the radio
/// transmits the ACK. Ensure the transmit buffer contains data loaded by
/// RAIL_WriteTxFifo().
///
/// Standard-based protocols that contain auto-ACK functionality are normally

 *
 * Channel hopping provides a hardware accelerated method for
 * scanning across multiple channels quickly, as part of a receive protocol.
 * While it is possible to call \ref RAIL_StartRx on different channels,
 * back to back, and listen on many channels sequentially in that way, the

 * protocols. This API pre-computes necessary channel change operations
 * for a given list of channels, so that the radio can move from channel
 * to channel much faster. Additionally, it leads to more succinct code
 * as channel changes will be done implicitly, without requiring numerous calls
