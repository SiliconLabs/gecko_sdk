/// The functions in this group configure RAIL IEEE 802.15.4 hardware
/// acceleration which includes IEEE 802.15.4 format filtering, address
/// filtering, ACKing, and filtering based on the frame type.
///
/// To configure IEEE 802.15.4 functionality, the application must first set up
/// a RAIL instance with RAIL_Init() and other setup functions.
/// Instead of RAIL_ConfigChannels(), however, an
/// application may use RAIL_IEEE802154_Config2p4GHzRadio() to set up the
/// official IEEE 2.4 GHz 802.15.4 PHY. This configuration is shown below.
///
/// 802.15.4 defines its macAckWaitDuration from the end of the transmitted
/// packet to complete reception of the ACK. RAIL's ackTimeout only covers
/// sync word detection of the ACK. Therefore, subtract the ACK's
/// PHY header and payload time to get RAIL's ackTimeout setting.
/// For 2.4 GHz OQPSK, macAckWaitDuration is specified as 54 symbols;
/// subtracting 2-symbol PHY header and 10-symbol payload yields a RAIL
/// ackTimeout of 42 symbols or 672 microseconds at 16 microseconds/symbol.

/// triggered in which case it will default to the
/// \ref RAIL_IEEE802154_Config_t::defaultFramePendingInOutgoingAcks setting.

 * is enabled).
 *
 * The application is expected to handle this event by calling \ref
 * RAIL_GetRxIncomingPacketInfo() and parsing the partly-received incoming
 * frame to determine the type of ACK needed:
 * - If an Immediate ACK, determine Frame Pending needs based on the packet
 *   type and addressing information and call \ref
 *   RAIL_IEEE802154_ToggleFramePending() if necessary;
 * - If an Enhanced ACK, generate the complete payload of the Enhanced ACK
 *   including any Frame Pending information and call \ref
 *   RAIL_IEEE802154_WriteEnhAck() in time for that Enhanced ACK to
 *   be sent. If not called in time, \ref RAIL_EVENT_TXACK_UNDERFLOW will
 *   likely result.
 *   Note that if 802.15.4 MAC-level encryption is used with Version 2
 *   frames, the application should decrypt the MAC Command byte in a
 *   MAC Command frame to determine whether it is a Data Request or other
 *   MAC Command.
 *
 * An application can also enable \ref
 * RAIL_IEEE802154_EnableEarlyFramePending() if the protocol doesn't
 * need to examine the MAC Command byte of MAC Command frames but can
 * infer it to be a Data Request.
 *
 * On 802.15.4E GB868 platforms that lack this support, legacy Immediate ACKs
 * are sent/expected for received/transmitted ACK-requesting 802.15.4E Frame
 * Version 2 frames; calls to \ref RAIL_IEEE802154_WriteEnhAck() have no

 *

 * - On platforms where \ref RAIL_FEAT_IEEE802154_G_4BYTE_CRC_SUPPORTED
 *   is true: automatic per-packet 2/4-byte Frame Check Sequence (FCS)
 *   reception and transmission based on the FCS Type bit in the

 *   and automatically-generated ACKs reflect the CRC size of the
 *   incoming frame being acknowledged (i.e., their MAC payload will be
 *   increased to 7 bytes when sending 4-byte FCS).
 *   On other platforms, only the 2-byte FCS is supported.
 * - On platforms where \ref RAIL_FEAT_IEEE802154_G_UNWHITENED_RX_SUPPORTED
 *   and/or \ref RAIL_FEAT_IEEE802154_G_UNWHITENED_TX_SUPPORTED are true:
 *   automatic per-packet whitened/unwhitened reception and transmission,

 *   PHY header. This includes ACK reception and automatically-generated ACKs
 *   which reflect the whitening of the incoming frame being acknowledged.
 *   On other platforms, only whitened frames are supported.
 * - Support for frames up to 2049 bytes per the radio configuration's
 *   maximum packet length setting.
 *
 * @note Sending/receiving whitened frames assumes the radio configuration
 *   has established an appropriate 802.15.4-compliant whitening algorithm.
 *   RAIL does not itself override the radio configuration's whitening
