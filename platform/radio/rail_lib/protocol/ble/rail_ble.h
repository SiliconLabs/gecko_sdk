/// The APIs in this module configure the radio for BLE
/// operation and provide additional helper routines necessary for
/// normal BLE send/receive that aren't available directly in RAIL.
/// RAIL APIs should be used to set up the application. However,
/// RAIL_ConfigChannels() and RAIL_ConfigRadio() should not be called to set up
/// the PHY. Instead, RAIL_BLE_Config* APIs should be used to set up the
/// 1 Mbps, 2 Mbps, or Coded PHY configurations needed by the application. These
/// APIs will configure the hardware and also configure the set of valid BLE
/// channels.
///
/// To implement a standard BLE link layer, you will also need to handle tight
/// turnaround times and send packets at specific instants. This can all be
/// managed through general RAIL functions, such as RAIL_ScheduleTx(),
/// RAIL_ScheduleRx(), and RAIL_SetStateTiming(). See RAIL APIs for more
/// useful functions.
///
/// A simple example to set up the application to be in BLE mode is shown
/// below. Note that this will put the radio on the first advertising channel
/// with the advertising Access Address. In any full-featured BLE application you
/// will need to use the RAIL_BLE_ConfigChannelRadioParams() function to change

 *
 * If a TX error occurs during the repetition, the process will abort and the
 * TX error transition from \ref RAIL_SetTxTransitions will be used. If the
 * repetition completes successfully, then the TX success transition from
 * \ref RAIL_SetTxTransitions will be used.
 *
 * Any call to \ref RAIL_Idle or \ref RAIL_StopTx will clear the pending
 * repeated transmits. The state will also be cleared by another call to this
 * function. To clear the repeated transmits before they've started without
 * stopping other radio actions, call this function with a \ref
 * RAIL_BLE_TxRepeatConfig_t::iterations count of 0. A DMP switch will clear this
 * state only if the initial transmit triggering the repeated transmits has
 * started.
 *
 * The application is responsible for populating the transmit data to be used
 * by the repeated transmits via \ref RAIL_SetTxFifo or \ref RAIL_WriteTxFifo.
 * Data will be transmitted from the TX FIFO. If the TX FIFO does not have
 * sufficient data to transmit, a TX error will be caused and a \ref
 * RAIL_EVENT_TX_UNDERFLOW will occur. In order to avoid an underflow, the
 * application should queue data to be transmitted as early as possible.
 *
 * This function will fail to configure the repetition if a transmit of any
 * kind is ongoing, including during the time between an initial transmit and
 * the end of a previously-configured repetition.
