# This list will specify the framework-contributed .hwconf files to a project.
# There is an ordered list of .hwconf files that get contributed to a project.
#   SDK-contributed files (see ../../hwconf.xml)

#   Sample app-contributed files (from sample apps)
# When AppBuilder generates, it will make a list of all of the compatible
# .hwconf files applied from the SDK, then the framework, then the sample app.
