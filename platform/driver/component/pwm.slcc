description: >
  The PWM driver uses a high frequency hardware timer to generate Pulse Width
  Modulated (PWM) waveforms with configurable frequency, polarity and duty
  cycle. Each PWM output requires one TIMER Compare/Capture channel.


  This component is instantiable, meaning that several named instances can be
  created. For each instance a configuration is generated along with an
  initialization struct set according to this configuration. These instance
  defines and variables are available in a generated header file,
  sl_pwm_instances.h.


  If the Services->Runtime->System Setup->System Init component is included in
  a project, the driver instances will be initialized automatically, using the
  instance configurations, during the sl_system_init() call in main.c.


  Selecting this component will also include the PWM Core component, which is
  the implementation of the PWM driver itself.
