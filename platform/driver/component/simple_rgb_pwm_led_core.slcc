description: >
  The Simple RGB PWM LED Driver provides an implementation of the Generic LED
  API. This driver supports controlling Red/Green/Blue LED sets and uses
  Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to set the intensity of each LED.


  This component includes only the Simple RGBW PWM LED driver core. To configure and create
  instances of this driver, the Simple RGBW PWM LED component should be included in the
  project.
