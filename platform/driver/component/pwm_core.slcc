description: >
  The PWM driver uses a high frequency hardware timer to generate Pulse Width
  Modulated (PWM) waveforms with configurable frequency, polarity and duty
  cycle.


  This component includes only the PWM driver core. To configure and create
  instances of this driver, the PWM component should be included in the
  project.
