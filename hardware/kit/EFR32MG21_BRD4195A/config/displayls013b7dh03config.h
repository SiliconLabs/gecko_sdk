 * If POLARITY_INVERSION_EXTCOMIN is defined, the polarity inversion is armed
 * for every rising edge of the EXTCOMIN pin. The actual polarity inversion is
 * triggered at the next transision of SCS. This mode is recommended because it
 * causes less CPU and SPI load than the alternative mode, see below.
 * If POLARITY_INVERSION_EXTCOMIN is undefined, the polarity inversion is
 * toggled by sending an SPI command. This mode causes more CPU and SPI load
 * than using the EXTCOMIN pin mode.
