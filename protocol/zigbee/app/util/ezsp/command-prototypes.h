// LEGACY FUNCTION: This functionality has been replaced by a single bit in the
// EmberApsFrame, EMBER_APS_OPTION_DSA_SIGN. Devices wishing to send signed
// messages should use that as it requires fewer function calls and message
// buffering. The dsaSignHandler response is still called when
// EMBER_APS_OPTION_DSA_SIGN is used. However, this function is still supported.
// This function begins the process of signing the passed message contained
// within the messageContents array. If no other ECC operation is going on, it
// will immediately return with EMBER_OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS to indicate the
// start of ECC operation. It will delay a period of time to let APS retries
// take place, but then it will shut down the radio and consume the CPU
// processing until the signing is complete. This may take up to 1 second. The
// signed message will be returned in the dsaSignHandler response. Note that the
// last byte of the messageContents passed to this function has special
// significance. As the typical use case for DSA signing is to sign the ZCL
// payload of a DRLC Report Event Status message in SE 1.0, there is often both
// a signed portion (ZCL payload) and an unsigned portion (ZCL header). The last
// byte in the content of messageToSign is therefore used as a special indicator
// to signify how many bytes of leading data in the array should be excluded
// from consideration during the signing process. If the signature needs to
// cover the entire array (all bytes except last one), the caller should ensure
// that the last byte of messageContents is 0x00. When the signature operation
// is complete, this final byte will be replaced by the signature type indicator
// (0x01 for ECDSA signatures), and the actual signature will be appended to the
// original contents after this byte.
