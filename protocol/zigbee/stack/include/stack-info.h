/** @brief A callback invoked when the status of the stack changes.
 * If the status parameter equals ::EMBER_NETWORK_UP, the
 * ::emberGetNetworkParameters()
 * function can be called to get the new network parameters. If any of the
 * parameters are stored in nonvolatile memory by the application, the
 * stored values should be updated.
 *
 * The application is free to begin messaging after it receives the
 * ::EMBER_NETWORK_UP status.  However, routes discovered immediately after
 * the stack comes up may be suboptimal because the routes are based
 * on the neighbor table's information about two-way links with neighboring nodes,
 * which is obtained from periodic ZigBee Link Status messages.  It can take
 * two or three link status exchange periods (of 16 seconds each) before the
 * neighbor table has a good estimate of link quality to neighboring nodes.
 * Therefore, the application may improve the quality of initially discovered
 * routes by waiting after startup to give the neighbor table time
 * to be populated.

/** @brief Enable boost power mode and/or the alternate transmit path.
 *
 * Boost power mode is a high-performance radio mode,
 * which offers increased transmit power and receive sensitivity at the cost of
 * an increase in power consumption. ::emberInit() calls this
 * function using the power mode and transmitter output settings as specified
 * in the MFG_PHY_CONFIG token (with each bit inverted so that the default
 * token value of 0xffff corresponds to normal power mode and bi-directional RF
 * transmitter output). The application only needs to call
 * ::emberSetTxPowerMode() to use a power mode or transmitter output
 * setting different than specified in the MFG_PHY_CONFIG token.
 * After the initial call to ::emberSetTxPowerMode(), the stack
 * will automatically maintain the specified power mode configuration across
 * sleep/wake cycles.
 *
 * @param txPowerMode Specifies which transmit power mode options should
 * be activated. This parameter should be set to one of the literal values
 * described in stack/include/ember-types.h. Any power option not specified
 * in the txPowerMode parameter will be deactivated.
 *

 * will call ::emberRadioNeedsCalibratingHandler() to inform the application
 * that it should perform calibration of the current channel as soon as
 * possible. Calibration can take up to 150 ms. The default callback function
 * implementation provided here performs the calibration immediately. The
 * application can define its own callback by defining
 * ::EMBER_APPLICATION_HAS_CUSTOM_RADIO_CALIBRATION_CALLBACK in its
 * CONFIGURATION_HEADER. It can then failsafe any critical processes or
