 * @brief
 * Defines a platform abstraction layer for the Z-Wave power manager.
 *
 * The ZPAL power manager offers an API for registering power locks and for receiving events on power mode 
 * transitions. Power lock forces the chip to stay awake in a given power mode for a given time.
 * An event handler is invoked every time the transition between power modes occurs.
 *
 * Infinite lock example:\n
 * @code{.c}
 * zpal_pm_handle_t handle = zpal_pm_register(ZPAL_PM_TYPE_USE_RADIO);  // Register the power lock that keeps radio active
 * zpal_pm_stay_awake(handle, 0);                                       // Keep the radio active forever
 *                                                                      // Other stuff
 * zpal_pm_cancel(handle);                                              // The chip may go to sleep now
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Lock with timeout example:\n
 * @code{.c}
 * zpal_pm_handle_t handle = zpal_pm_register(ZPAL_PM_TYPE_USE_RADIO);  // Register the power lock that keeps radio active
 * zpal_pm_stay_awake(handle, 2000);                                    // Keep the radio active for 2000 ms from now
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * - The storage for power locks should be able to hold at least 20 items. Note that this number may change in the future.
