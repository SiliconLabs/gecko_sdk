description:
  "This component provides the PSA Crypto API, a high-level interface to various \
  cryptographic functions.\n

  In order to enable the PSA Crypto core functionality, this component includes \
  function APIs, a set of PSA drivers for various devices from Silicon Labs, \
  and built-in support for the Mbed TLS library functions. The Mbed TLS software \
  functions are provided as a mean to 'fallback' when there is no support for \
  hardware acceleration on the device.\n

  Certain algorithms need to be manually enabled in order to be supported: \
  this is done by selecting the corresponding component. In order to use ECDH \
  for key agreement, for example, the 'PSA Crypto Support for ECDH' component \
  needs to be selected. Note that just because a separate component does not \
  exist for a certain algorithm, it does not mean that it is not supported and \
  accelerated -- this is a work in progress.\n

  For configuration of PSA Crypto, please refer to the 'Mbed TLS' component."
