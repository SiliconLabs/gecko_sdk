label: MVP Accelerated Kernels
description: >
  This component includes kernel implementations that are accelerated 
  using the MVP accelerator on compatible devices. By including this
  component, the MVP kernel implementations will be used instead of the
  optimized kernels.
  
  The kernels which have MVP accelerated implementations are:
  pooling, fully_connected, add, conv, depthwise_conv and transpose_conv.
  Remaining kernels fall back to using optimized or reference kernel
  implementations.
