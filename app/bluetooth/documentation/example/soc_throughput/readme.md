# SoC - Throughput

This example allows measuring data throughput between EFR32 devices as well as between an EFR32 and a smartphone running the EFR Connect mobile app.

## Getting started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

This example implements a GATT service that can be used to measure application data throughput using acknowledged or unacknowledged transactions, namely indications or notifications.

This throughput measurement setup has three use cases:

1. EFR32 (SoC) <-> Mobile phone + EFR Connect
2. EFR32 (SoC) <-> EFR32 (SoC)
3. EFR32 (SoC) <-> EFR32 (NCP) + Host (typically PC)

The two last use cases require two Silicon Labs kits, such as [SLWSTK6021A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg22-wireless-starter-kit), [SLTB010A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-bg22-kit) or [BGM220-EK4314A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/bluetooth/bgm220-explorer-kit).

To test throughput against a smartphone, install EFR Connect for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siliconlabs.bledemo&hl=en&gl=US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/efr-connect/id1030932759). Source code for the mobile app is available on [Github](https://github.com/SiliconLabs?q=efrconnect&type=&language=&sort=).

### EFR32 (SoC) <-> Mobile phone + EFR Connect

For this use case only one kit is required. After flashing the example the firmware will boot as a peripheral by default, and the mobile phone acts as a central device.

Open EFR Connect, go to the demo view and select the Throughput demo. A pop-up shows all the devices that are running the **Bluetooth - SoC Throughput** firmware. Tap on the device to go into the Throughput demo view.

Data can be pushed to the smartphone by pressing PB0 (notifications) or PB1 (indications) on the mainboard. From the mobile app side data can be pushed to the EFR32 by tapping the Start button at the bottom. The data transfer type (notifications/indications) can be selected at the top of the connection parameters window.

The animation below showcases the demo running on a BGM220 Explorer Kit (BGM220-EK4314A) with the mobile app running on an Android device.

### EFR (SoC) <-> EFR32 (SoC)

For this use case the **Bluetooth - SoC Throughput** example must be flashed on both kits. By default the firmware boots in peripheral mode but it can boot in central mode by keeping PB0 pressed while resetting the device. The role can be read from the first line on the display.

Throughput testing can start as soon as the devices establish a connection and subscribe to indications/notifications on each other's GATT database. The status is indicated on the second line of the display. When both side show "ST: Subscribed" then testing is ready to start.

Notifications can be pushed by pressing PB0 and indications can be pushed by pressing PB1. The data can be pushed from either device since both have the throughput service on their GATT database and they subscribe to notifications/indications on the remote device's GATT.

Data will be sent for as long as the button is pressed on the device and the status will be "ST: Testing" during that time.

Once the button is released the average throughput will be calculated and shown on the display as well as how many packets were sent. This information is on the two last lines of the display.

### EFR32 (SoC) <-> EFR32 (NCP) + Host (typically PC)

The final use case consists of one kit flashed with **Bluetooth - SoC Throughput** example and a second kit flashed with **Bluetooth - NCP**. The NCP device will be controlled by a dedicated host application which is located in *<SDK-installation-location>\app\bluetooth\example_host\throughput*. 

To learn more about NCP firmware and how to build the host applications, see [AN1259: Using the v3.x Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf).

In this setup data can only be sent from the SoC to the NCP device because the NCP firmware does not contain the Throughput service in its GATT server.

## Additional Notes

These next sections describe some more details about the example.

### Operation on 1-button boards

The **Bluetooth - SoC Throughput** example also runs on boards that only have 1 user button, such as [SLTB010A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-bg22-kit) or [BGM220-EK4314A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/bluetooth/bgm220-explorer-kit). The behavior is determined by the button press duration:
* Short press switches between sending notifications or indications. The default out of boot is sending notifications.
* Long press sends data.
* To boot into central mode instead of periperal, keep the button pressed while resetting the device.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)

The **Bluetooth - SoC Throughput** example has a CLI that is used to report activity as well as modify parameters in runtime. You can easily access the CLI with a terminal emulator such as Tera Term or from within [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio) by right-clicking the debug adapter and selecting Launch Console. On the Serial 1 tab, type 'help' on the command prompt.

The available command set allows multiple options such as changing connection parameters, MTU size, TX power, among others.

On devices without display, the CLI is used for printing a virtual display which mimics the physical display on the mainboard.

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To get your application to work, either
- flash a bootloader to the device or
- uninstall the **OTA DFU** and **Bootloader Application Interface** software components.

To flash a bootloader, either create a bootloader project or run a precompiled **Demo** on your device from the Launcher view. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Then flash your own application image to overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - NCP** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
