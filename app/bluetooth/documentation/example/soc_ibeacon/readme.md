# SoC - iBeacon

An iBeacon device is an implementation that sends non-connectable advertisements in iBeacon format. The iBeacon Service gives Bluetooth accessories a simple and convenient way to send iBeacon to smartphones. This example can be tested together with the EFR Connect mobile app.

## Getting Started

Introduced in iOS 7, iBeacon enables new location awareness possibilities for apps. Leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a device with iBeacon technology can be used to establish a region around an object. This allows an iOS device to determine when it has entered or left the region, along with an estimation of proximity to a beacon.

For more beacon information, see [Apple iBeacon](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/)

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

To run this example, you will need:

- Any Bluetooth Low Energy-compatible [radio board](https://www.silabs.com/wireless/bluetooth),
- A smartphone with [EFR Connect app](https://www.silabs.com/developers/efr-connect-mobile-app) installed. (Note: On Android, the distance will not be calculated.)

The following picture shows the system view of how it works.

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Create the SoC-iBeacon project based on your hardware, then build and flash the image to your board. Alternatively, you could flash the pre-built demo image.

2. Open the *EFR Connect* app on your smartphone and allow the permission requested the first time it is opened.

3. Click [Develop] -> [Browser]. You will see a list of nearby devices that are sending Bluetooth advertisement. Find the one named "iBeacon" .

   You can also see the Minor, Major, and UUID number, and the EFR app will estimate the distance. (Note: On Android, the distance will not be calculated.)

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To get your application to work, either
- flash a bootloader to the device or
- uninstall the **OTA DFU** and **Bootloader Application Interface** software components.

To flash a bootloader, either create a bootloader project or run a precompiled **Demo** on your device from the Launcher view. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Then flash your own application image to overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - NCP** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
