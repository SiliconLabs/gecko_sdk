# NCP - Empty

This is a Network  Co-Processor (NCP) target application. It runs the Bluetooth stack and  provides access to it by exposing the Bluetooth API (BGAPI) via UART  connection. NCP mode makes it possible to run your application on a host  controller or PC.

Unlike the **Bluetooth - NCP** example, this example contains a minimal GATT database. It can be used with Bluetooth NCP Commander, but it cannot be used with host applications that use Dynamic GATT API. Use the Bluetooth - NCP example instead, when testing NCP host example applications, or remove the GATT database initialization part from the host example application.

## Getting Started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth software and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick-Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

In the NCP context, the application runs on a host MCU or PC, which is called the NCP Host, while the Bluetooth stack runs on an EFR32, which is called the NCP Target.

The NCP Host and Target communicate via a serial interface (UART), which can be tunneled either via USB or via Ethernet if you use a development kit. The communication between the NCP Host and Target is defined in the Silicon Labs proprietary protocol called BGAPI. BGLib is the reference implementation of the BGAPI protocol in C, which is to be used on the NCP Host side.

[AN1259: Using the v3.x Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf) provides a detailed description how NCP works and how to configure it for your custom hardware.

The following figures show the system view of NCP mode.

## Evaluating with Bluetooth NCP Commander

NCP Commander can be used to control the target and test NCP firmware without developing your own host application. In Simplicity Studio, browse to the launcher -> Compatible Tools tab -> open up NCP Commander. A shortcut to the Compatible Tools can also be found on the top toolbar. Follow the below steps to make the NCP target advertise.  See [AN1259: Using the Silicon Labs v3.x Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf) for additional details. 

1. Connect the board to a PC via USB and start NCP Commander from Simplicity Studio.
![step 1](readme_img3.png)
2. Choose your board from the list and click **Connect**.
![step 2](readme_img4.png)
3. The NCP host will try to get the Bluetooth address from the NCP target. If it succeeds, the connection is established.
4. Click **Create Set** and then **Start** under "Advertise Set (0)" table to start advertising. See the "Smart Console" for details.

5. Open the EFR Connect or any Bluetooth browser application to see your device advertising as "Silabs Example". You may also connect to the device and discover its GATT database.

## Extending the GATT database

The NCP-empty application implements a basic GATT database. GATT definitions can be extended using the GATT Configurator, which can be found under Advanced Configurators in the Software Components tab of the Project Configurator. To open the Project Configurator, open the .slcp file of the project.

To learn how to use the GATT Configurator, see [UG438: GATT Configurator Userâ€™s Guide for Bluetooth SDK v3.x](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug438-gatt-configurator-users-guide-sdk-v3x.pdf).

The other NCP target example project **Bluetooth - NCP** does not have a GATT database. It uses APIs to build up the database at runtime, which is preferred for NCP projects. With the Dynamic GATT Database solution, the target application does not need to be changed and synchronized with the Host part when the GATT Database is modified. If you still insist to use the GATT configurator, remove the GATT database initialization from the host example application. 

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To get your application to work, either
- flash a bootloader to the device or
- uninstall the **Bootloader Application Interface** software component.

To flash a bootloader, either create a bootloader project or run a precompiled **Demo** on your device from the Launcher view. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Then flash your own application image to overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - NCP** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
