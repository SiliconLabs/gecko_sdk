# SoC - DTM

This example application provides the Direct Test Mode (DTM) through a 2-wire UART interface for the RF PHY testing of a Bluetooth Low Energy device.

## Direct Test Mode (DTM) Overview

DTM is typically used with a separate Bluetooth Tester device.

DTM can be used either through a 2-wire UART interface, as described in this example, or over HCI, which is currently not supported. The 2-wire UART interface uses baud rates from 1200 up to 115200 bps (the default) always with 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and without flow control (no RTS nor CTS).

DTM can be also used without a separate Bluetooth Tester device when testing more manually with a spectrum analyzer and signal generator setup by sending the command bytes with a special terminal. To use this setup more easily, consider using the [BGTool](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1267-bt-rf-phy-evaluation-using-dtm-sdk-v3x.pdf) desktop application instead, which uses the [NCP-mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf) [BGAPI](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest)-interface.

Although the DTM is defined for the Bluetooth Qualifications, it can be used to run most of the Regulatory Certification tests.

Typical use cases for the DTM:
- SoCs:
  - Regulatory Certifications testing
  - RF-PHY testing for the Bluetooth Qualification if the design does not match the reference design
  - Production testing
- Modules:
  - Regulatory Certifications testing (required for the modules in Europe)
  - Spot checks (strongly recommended by FCC)
  - RF-PHY testing for the Bluetooth Qualification if the design might affect the module operation
  - Production testing
- Radio Boards with WSTK:
  - Mostly for getting to know the DTM overall and testing the setup
  - Typically not much practical usage

## Getting Started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

The instructions to create and flash the DTM example application are in the [AN1267: Radio Frequency Physical Layer Evaluation in Bluetooth SDK v3.x](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1267-bt-rf-phy-evaluation-using-dtm-sdk-v3x.pdf). The same document contains information about customizing UART pins for your own hardware, and examples illustrating using the DTM.

Detailed specifications are in the Bluetooth Specifications.

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To get your application to work, either
- flash a bootloader to the device or
- uninstall the **OTA DFU** and **Bootloader Application Interface** software components.

To flash a bootloader, either create a bootloader project or run a precompiled **Demo** on your device from the Launcher view. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Then flash your own application image to overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - NCP** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.

**Note!** With the mainboard and the Radio Board, the DTM example uses EXP-header UART pins by default and not the USB UART as most of the other examples. Also, the default is no flow control.
