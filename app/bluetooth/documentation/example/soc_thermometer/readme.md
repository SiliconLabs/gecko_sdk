# SoC - Thermometer

This example implements the Health Thermometer service. It enables a peer device to connect and receive temperature values via Bluetooth. The reported values are measured by a temperature sensor located on the mainboard.

## Getting Started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

This example implements the predefined [Thermometer Service](https://www.bluetooth.com/xml-viewer/?src=https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Services/org.bluetooth.service.health_thermometer.xml). To run this example, you will need:

- A mainboard with Bluetooth Low Energy-compatible [radio board](https://www.silabs.com/wireless/bluetooth).
- An *[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silicon-labs-blue-gecko-wstk/id1030932759?mt=8)* or *[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siliconlabs.bledemo)* smartphone with EFR Connect app installed.

The following picture shows the system view of how it works.

Follow these steps to get the temperature value on your smartphone.

1. Create the soc-thermometer project based on your hardware, then build and flash the image to your board. Alternatively, you could flash the pre-built demo image.

![step 1](readme_img2.png)

2. Open the *EFR Connect* app on your smartphone and allow the permission requested the first time it is opened.

3. Click [Develop] -> [Browser]. You will see a list of nearby devices that are sending Bluetooth advertisement. Find the one named "Thermometer Example" and click the `connect` button on the right side.

4. Wait for the connection to establish and GATT database to be loaded, then find the *Health Thermometer* service, and click `More Info`.

![step 4](readme_img4.png)

5. Four characteristics will show up. Find the *Temperature Measurement* and press the `indicate` button. Then, you will see the temperature value getting updated periodically. You should also see the temperature displayed change as you press the top of the sensor with your finger, as shown below. If your board is not connected to a temperature sensor (e.g., because of a limited number of available pins), a generated value will be shown which changes 1 degree Celsius every second.

Alternatively, you can follow the steps below instead of steps 3-5 to use the Health Thermometer feature in the app. This will automatically scan and list devices advertising the Health Thermometer service and, upon connection, will automatically enable notifications and display the temperature data.

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To get your application to work, either
- flash a bootloader to the device or
- uninstall the **OTA DFU** and **Bootloader Application Interface** software components.

To flash a bootloader, either create a bootloader project or run a precompiled **Demo** on your device from the Launcher view. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Then flash your own application image to overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - NCP** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
