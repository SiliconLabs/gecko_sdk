# SoC - Thermometer Client

This example demonstrates the operation of a client device in a multi-peripheral Bluetooth LE (BLE) topology. The Silicon Labs Bluetooth stack supports simultaneous connections for up to eight peripheral devices at one time. This example application illustrates how to handle simultaneous connection to four thermometer peripheral devices.

## Getting Started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

To get familiar with client and server roles, see [GATT Server and Client Roles](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/general/gatt-protocol/gatt-server-and-client-roles).

To learn more about central and peripheral roles, see [Central and Peripheral Roles](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/general/connections/central-and-peripheral-roles).

To learn more about multi-peripheral BLE topology, see [Multi-Peripheral Topology](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/general/connections/multiperipheral-topology).

## Evaluating the Application

To evaluate this application, you need one EFR32/BGM device running the **SoC Thermometer Client** example application, and at least one (but no more than four) peripheral devices running the **SoC Thermometer** application. The following figure shows the topological setup for testing this example.

When the client boots, it starts `Sanning`/`Discovering` advertising devices. It initiates a connection with those devices that contain the `Health Thermometer` service in their advertising packets.

After a connection is established, the client discovers the Health Thermometer service from the remote GATT database. After the service discovery is completed, the client discovers the thermometer characteristics and enables indications sent from a remote GATT server. The main GATT procedures are represented in the following state diagram.

After programming the devices, open your terminal emulator and connect to your client device over its serial port. Set baud rate to 115200. Power on the peripheral thermometer devices and observe the output readings on your terminal.

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To get your application to work, either
- flash a bootloader to the device or
- uninstall the **OTA DFU** and **Bootloader Application Interface** software components.

To flash a bootloader, either create a bootloader project or run a precompiled **Demo** on your device from the Launcher view. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Then flash your own application image to overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - NCP** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
