# SoC - Blinky

This example application is the "Hello World" of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It allows a BLE central device to control the LED on the mainboard and receive button press notifications.

## Getting started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

This example implements a simple custom GATT service with two characteristics. One characteristic controls the state of the LED (ON/OFF) via write operations from a GATT client, and the second characteristic sends notifications to subscribed clients when the button state changes (pressed or released).

To test this demo, install EFR Connect for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siliconlabs.bledemo&hl=en&gl=US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/efr-connect/id1030932759). Source code for the mobile app is available on [Github](https://github.com/SiliconLabs?q=efrconnect&type=&language=&sort=).

After launching the app go to the demo view and select the Blinky demo. A pop-up will show all the devices around you that are running the SoC-Blinky firmware. Tap on the device to go into the demo view.

Tap the light on the mobile app to toggle the LED on the mainboard. When you press/release the button on the mainboard the state changes for the virtual button on the app as well.

The animation below showcases the demo running on a BGM220 Explorer Kit (BGM220-EK4314A) with the mobile app running on an Android device.

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To get your application to work, either
- flash a bootloader to the device or
- uninstall the **OTA DFU** and **Bootloader Application Interface** software components.

To flash a bootloader, either create a bootloader project or run a precompiled **Demo** on your device from the Launcher view. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Then flash your own application image to overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth - NCP** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
