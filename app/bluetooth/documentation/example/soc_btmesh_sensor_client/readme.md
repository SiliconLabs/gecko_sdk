# Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Sensor Client

The **Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Sensor Client** example is a working example application that you can use as a template for Bluetooth Mesh Sensor Client applications.

The example demonstrates the Bluetooth Mesh Sensor Client Model. It collects and displays sensor measurement data from remote device(s) (for example **Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Sensor Server**). The current status is displayed on the LCD (if one is present on the mainboard) and also sent to UART. CLI commands may substitute for button presses if the mainboard has only one button available. This example requires one of the Internal Storage Bootloader (single image) variants depending on device memory.

## Getting Started

To learn Bluetooth mesh technology basics, see [Bluetooth Mesh Network - An Introduction for Developers](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mesh-Technology-Overview.pdf).

To get started with Bluetooth Mesh and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG176: Bluetooth Mesh SDK v2.x Quick Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg176-bluetooth-mesh-sdk-v2x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

The term SoC stands for "System on Chip", meaning that this is a standalone application that runs on the EFR32/BGM and does not require any external MCU or other active components to operate.

**Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Sensor Client** example collects sensor data from the sensor server. If it is used together with the soc-btmesh-sensor-server example then it will display occupancy (people count) sensor data, temperature data and illuminance (on Thunderboard Sense 2).

To add or remove features from the example, follow this process:

- Add model and feature components to your project
- Optionally configure your Mesh node through the "Bluetooth Mesh Configurator"

To learn more about programming an SoC application, see [UG472: Silicon Labs Bluetooth 速 Mesh Configurator User's guide for SDK v2.x](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug472-bluetooth-mesh-v2x-node-configuration-users-guide.pdf).

- Some components are configurable, and can be customized using the Component Editor

- Respond to the events raised by the Bluetooth stack
- Implement additional application logic

[UG295: Silicon Labs Bluetooth 速 Mesh C Application Developer's Guide for SDK v2.x](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug295-bluetooth-mesh-dev-guide.pdf) gives code-level information on the stack and the common pitfalls to avoid.

## Testing the Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Sensor Client Application

To test the application, do the following:

1. Make sure a bootloader is installed. See Troubleshooting section.
2. Build and flash the **Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Sensor Client** example to your device.
3. Reset the device by pressing and releasing the reset button on the mainboard while pressing BTN0. The message "Factory reset" should appear on the LCD screen.
4. Provision the device in one of three ways:

   - NCP Host provisioner examples, see for example an SDK folder `app/bluetooth/example_host/btmesh_provisioner` or [github](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/bluetooth_mesh_stack_features/tree/master/provisioning)

   - NCP Commander with NCP target device, see [Bluetooth NCP Commander guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-tools-bluetooth-ncp-commander) or [AN1259: Using the v3.x Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf)

   - For Mobile Phone use, see the [QSG176: Bluetooth Mesh SDK v2.x Quick-Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg176-bluetooth-mesh-sdk-v2x-quick-start-guide.pdf) for more information how to download and use the Silicon Labs Bluetooth Mesh application.

   Mobile Phone provisioning is illustrated in the following figure.

5. Open the app and choose the Provision Browser and tap **Scan**. The device sending unprovisioned beacons should appear, tap **PROVISION**:

6. Start provisioning using the "Continue" button:

7. Configure the device as "Sensor Client" and select the correct group to which the messages will subscribe (Demo group).

8. Once the node is provisioned and correctly configured, it is ready to function in your demo network.

9. The next step is to add a sensor server or several into your network, if it has not already been done. This is required to fully test the whole system. Read the applicable example project documentation to learn more.

For more information on the example, see [AN1300: Understanding the Silicon Labs Bluetooth Mesh SDK v2.x Sensor Model Demonstration](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1300-understanding-bluetooth-mesh-sensor-model-demo-sdk-2x.pdf).

The button presses in this example:

- Short presses update the registered devices
- Long press of PB0 changes the current property

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To install a bootloader, from the Launcher perspective's EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS tab either build and flash one of the bootloader examples or run one of the precompiled demos. Precompiled demos flash a bootloader as well as the application image.

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Switch** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth Mesh - NCP Empty** demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
