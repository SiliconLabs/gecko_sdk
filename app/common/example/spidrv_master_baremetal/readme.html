<h1>SPI Master Baremetal application</h1>
<p>This example project demonstrates use of the Serial Peripheral Interface in master mode 
in a bare-metal configuration.</p>
<p>Once the master application is installed on a starter kit, the kit can be connected 
via the 20-pint expansion header to a second kit which has the slave application installed.</p>
<p>The expansion header pins must be connected as the following:
Connect master CS to slave CS
Connect master SCLK to slave SCLK
Connect master MOSI to slave MOSI
Connect master MISO to slave MISO</p>
<p>The user can then connect to the device via the VCOM serial connection. The master and slave
devices will periodically exchange data, logging the exchanges over VCOM.</p>
