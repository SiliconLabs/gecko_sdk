<h1>I2C SPM Baremetal application</h1>
<p>This example project demonstrates how to use the I2C Simple Polled Master driver 
using the Si7021 Relative Humidity and Temperature Sensor in a bare-metal configuration.</p>
<p>The initial temperature is read, and upper and lower limits are calculated based
on TEMPERATURE_BAND_C. When the current temperature reaches the upper limit, LED0 is turned on and LED1 is turned off. When the current temperature reaches the upper limit, LED1 is turned on and LED0 is turned off.</p>
<p>Information is also output on the VCOM serial port. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This example is meant to showcase the I2C SPM driver not the Si7021 Sensor. To use the Si7021 sensor, use the Si70xx driver instead.</p>
