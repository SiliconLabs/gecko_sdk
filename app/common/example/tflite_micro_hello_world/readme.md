# TensorFlow Lite Micro - Hello World

This application demonstrates a model trained to replicate a sine function. The
model is continuously fed with values ranging from 0 to 2pi, and the output of
the model is used to control the intensity of an LED. Inference results are also
printed over VCOM.

This is a port of TensorFlow's hello world application. For details about the 
application or information on how to train your own model, visit the TensorFlow
